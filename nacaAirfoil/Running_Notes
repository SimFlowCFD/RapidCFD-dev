nacaAirfoil
~~~~~~~~~~~
* large domain with airfoil section near centre
* extremely non-orthogonal, highly skew mesh refined around the airfoil
* running at Mach 1.78
* limited corrected 0.5 on all laplacianSchemes because the mesh is so poor
* run to t = 0.02 with nextWrite; change to stopAt endTime to continue running
* deltaT can be increased later in the run to 2e-07
